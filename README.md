## Complete Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

Before deploying this solution, ensure you have:

#### Databricks Workspace Requirements
- Databricks workspace in **us-east-1** or **us-west-2** (required for Agent Bricks)
- **Mosaic AI Agent Bricks Preview** enabled
- **Unity Catalog** configured
- **Serverless compute** available
- Access to **foundation models** (for LLM endpoints)

#### Required Tools
- [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html) configured with workspace authentication
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (>= 1.0)
- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) Python package manager
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for JSON processing

### End-to-End Deployment Process

The deployment follows a specific order due to component dependencies:

```
Phase 1: Data Foundation     → Phase 2: Knowledge Assistant
        ↓                            ↓
Phase 3: Dashboard & Genie   → Phase 4: Chat Application
```

#### Phase 1: Data Foundation
1. Import datasets into Databricks
2. Upload parquet files from megacorp_data/ to Unity Catalog
3. Configure tables: megacorp_campaigns, megacorp_audience_census_profile, megacorp_segment_definitions

#### Phase 2: Knowledge Assistant Creation
1. Create Knowledge Assistant using Agent Bricks
2. Upload policy documents from knowledge_assistant_policies/ into a Unity Catalog Volume
3. Create & Deploy a knowledge assistant AI Brick in Agent Bricks
4. Update `adtech_series/app_lakebase/resources/agent.job.yml with your agent endpoint.

#### Phase 3: Dashboard & Genie Space
1. Import MegaCorp Campaigns AIBI Demo.lvdash.json
2. Update Dashboard to point your imported tables
3. Generate an [embedded dashboard](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dashboards/embedding/) and copy the URI to the environment variable `DASHBOARD_IFRAME` in [app.yml](adtech_series/app_lakebase/app/app.yml)
4. Create Genie Space connected to your data, look at [GENIE.md](GENIE.md) for instructions.
5. Update `genie_space_id` in the [agent deployment job](adtech_series/app_lakebase/resources/agent.job.yml).

#### Phase 4: Chat Application & Multi-Agent Deployment
```bash
cd adtech_series/app_lakebase/

# Complete end to end deployment of the agent and application
just full-deploy-agent

# Compelte end to end deployment of the application
just full-deploy

# Or step-by-step:
just terraform-full      # Deploy infrastructure
just set-secret          # Setup secret for Agent Endpoint
just bundle-deploy       # Deploy our asset bundle
just migrations-upgreade # Run SQL migrations
just agent-deploy        # Deploy AI agents
just app-start           # Start compute
just app-deploy          # Deploy to compute
```

### Validation Steps

After deployment, verify each component:

1. **Data Layer**: Query tables in Unity Catalog
2. **Knowledge Assistant**: Test policy questions via Agent Bricks UI
3. **Dashboard**: Open Lakeview dashboard and verify data visualization
4. **Genie Space**: Test natural language queries
5. **Chat Application**: Access deployed app and test multi-agent conversations

### Configuration Files

Key configuration files to customize:

- `adtech_series/app_lakebase/databricks.yml` - Workspace and bundle configuration
- `adtech_series/app_lakebase/app/app.yml` - Application environment variables
- `adtech_series/app_lakebase/terraform/terraform.tfvars` - Infrastructure variables

### Common Deployment Issues

- **Agent Bricks Access**: Ensure workspace has preview feature enabled
- **Region Requirements**: Must be in us-east-1 or us-west-2
- **Endpoint Dependencies**: Knowledge Assistant must be deployed before chat app
- **Data Connections**: Verify table permissions and catalog access
- **Authentication**: Ensure proper service principal configuration
